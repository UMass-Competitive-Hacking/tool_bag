# Bag of tricks for UMass Competitive Hacking teams

Maybe one day we'll have our own server up that we can just leave these sorts of things on...one day.

Until then, the files contained in this directory are all sorted based on the topic you're looking for.

Some topics include
  1. Skeletal code for a basic Flask server
  2. .vimrc suggestions and usage guidance
  3. How to use git
  4. Idea center (beta, more on that in the section)

There will be more added/removed as time goes on.  The main purpose of this repo is to create a hub of information that we all search for and use to setup different environments in the first hour or so of every hackathon.  If you'd like to contribute, do something.  I don't know what, since nobody can really see this...I guess email me (Jon Bond)
